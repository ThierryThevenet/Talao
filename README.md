# The-Global-Freelancing-Dapp

Pitch

Scenario #1 - The Global Freelancing Dapp


This is a distributed application on the Ethereum blockchain allowing independents liaise with individuals or companies interested in their services.


The target community is that freelancers have enough to pay a commission on proprietary platforms. The community can be organized into several smaller communities that will be managed as DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization).


The Token is the use of the Dapp to cover its operating costs on the Ethereum blockchain and operating costs specific off-chain functionalities. It is a hybrid type of Token USER and WORK


Benefits paid to freelancers are made in USD / EUR or Token. 


The Dapp consists of protocols and gateways in open source. 


An ICO is expected in Q2 / 2018 to fund over 3 years the development of the protocol and  first gateways.

Scenario #2 - The OpenExperts Dapp

This is a distributed application on the Ethereum blockchain allowing experts and consultants 


Dapp overview

The Global Freelancing Dapp  consists of all protocols and gateways available to freelancers for their use or that of their clients.


The gateway allows customers to contact the freelance community. Specifically the gateway can expose an application to seek competence, to organize a tender, to organize an online interview ...... .. and of course to pay the benefit to freelancers.....


The gateway is possibly specific vertically by industry and necessarily specific to the type of service (expertise, software development, graphic design, translation ....). For example, the gateway for business expertise will be that of the Emindhub platform but for instance a gateway in the field of graphic design will integrate the tools to do competitions, ..... 


The gateways are available as open source. The gateways must be installed on server unix / windows and be accessible by smartphone in a classic web architecture. To simplify a gateway will be installed on one machine but developers can perform specific gateways and install on their own servers. The gateway is off chain, ie they are on servers that are not necessarily Ethereum nodes. There are therefore operating costs (mining) and Token are paid to the owners of the servers that host these gateways. 


The protocols are open source, built on smart Ethereum contracts. There is a lot to take in Colony.io with an organization in several communities by profession with specific protocols for each community. The protocols used for example to register, co-opt, manage reputation, obtain certification, manage payments missions, setup project team, etc.


Some features are complex protocols (eg management reputation like Colony.io protocol) and unsuited to treatment on blockchain and will be off-chain probably integrated into gateways.


The freelancers register, respond to offers, manage their reputation and are paid their benefits, with the only mining operating costs paid with through Token. 


Customers present their offers with the only operating costs; they pay token or USD / EUR. Payment mission is managed by the platform (without taking commission or a levy for the establishment of a reserve). The missions are paid flat or possibly Token but it must be considered that the customer will pay in USD or Euros not to compel and not to put pressure on freelancers. For the customer must also provide that each can be paid in USD / Euros though then it is an internal exchange with Tokens to use the protocols and gateways that run only Tokens.


The benefit of the establishment of a blockchain solution on the Freelancing platform market is the minimization of costs, particularly fees levied on missions. We can however provide for the establishment of a reserve fund by applying a very small benefit levy (to be defined ... 1%). This reserve fund will be established to benefit the community for example the launch of open source projects not provided for in the ICO white paper and will also take over funding of the ICO after the initial period of development. The use and the amount of the reserve fund will be proposals and community votes (DAO).


The use of the Global Freelancing Dapp will never be totally free. 0% commission on jobs is possible but it will pay a small amount (of about 0.5USD) to enter a CV, an offer or search expertise. This is at least the price of using the Ethereum blockchain to which must be added the cost of mining to specific gateways and off-chain functionality.


The Token and ICO


The token is that of the freelance community to the use of Dapp. The community is ultimately the owner of the Dapp through a token that allows the use (Token type USER). Customers are not in this community. They are in contact with the community through gateways. EmidHub is such a gateway for business expertise.


The use of protocols and gateways (at a cost of mining) is paid with Token. The mining gateways adds WORK function token which is therefore a hybrid type USER + WORK


The ICO is therefore open to all freelancers who have sick leave 10 to 20% of their job to proprietary platforms and who want now their own free solution. This program allows freelancers to use the Dapp during its early stages. They also allow more committed to receive rewards for the animation of their community by performing tasks such as mining, writing proposals for the life of the community (eg the reserve fund management), for co-option, etc. We can win Token working for the community.


The Emindhub S.A company is supporting the ICO. The ICO helps raise funds for the realization of an operational complete solution with all protocols and a coherent set of gateways. The development is planned over 3 years maximum. The date of the ICO is expected in Q2 / 2018 ... ...


The Tokens are also issued to existing shareholders of Emindhub SA, the founders, the company itself, the partners and first freelance community. The founders are therefore paid for 3 years and have a Token capital.


This will require the preparation of an operational gateway ICO with a first set of protocols to replicate with the new Blockchain architecture the normal use of the existing EmindHub platform.


There is no business plan . ICO funds allow operation over 3 years of the company (like a foundation). After 3 years we can imagine another ICO or just let the community the opportunity to use the reserve fund to finance maintenance and future features.


The preparation of the ICO requires time and financial resources (to evaluate). These means may be provided by the existing shareholders, new entrants (D.Lafont ,, T.Thevenet, others?) and nez investor.
